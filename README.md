# DevOps Test

### Scenario

Two guys in Bali (Bryan and Edward) get together and decide to launch a website selling toys. They have a Developer and a QA person who have developed a `Shopify` theme based on the following project https://github.com/Shopify/starter-theme

The Developer and QA have asked Bryan and Edward to draft in a DevOps person to help them continuously integrate and deploy their code changes into Shopify.

### The Ask

### Deploy the theme to Shopify

3. Add anup@simplipleasure.com, italo@simplipleasure.com, jesse@simplipleasure.com as users to the Shopify store.

Write up how the experience was for you.
